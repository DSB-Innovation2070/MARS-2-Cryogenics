MARS: Magnetic Active Refrigeration Systems
High-Frequency, Helium-Free Cryogenic Solutions
Project Overview

The MARS (Magnetic Active Refrigeration System) project introduces a paradigm shift in thermal management. By utilizing high-frequency solid-state magnetic modulation, this technology enables vibration-free, scalable cooling for quantum computing and aerospace instrumentation without the need for liquid helium.
Evolution: MARS 2 to MARS 3
MARS 2: Static Solid-State Cooling

MARS 2 served as the proof-of-concept for eliminating moving parts in magnetic refrigeration.

    Core Tech: Stationary Magnetocaloric Effect (MCE) switching.

    Operation: Low-frequency (1 Hz - 100 Hz) gating logic.

MARS 3: The High-Frequency Breakthrough

MARS 3 solves the fundamental "thermal lag" issue through ultra-high-frequency gating.

    Innovation: The Boghian-Shift phase-locked algorithm.

    Frequency: 1.0 GHz to 1.2 GHz switching via Gallium Nitride (GaN) HFET arrays.

    Energy: Integrated Active Energy Recuperation (AER) for maximum efficiency.

The Boghian-Shift Algorithm

Traditional magnetic refrigeration fails at GHz speeds due to molecular spin inertia. The Boghian-Shift kernel calculates the precise nanosecond phase offset required to synchronize magnetic pulses:
ϕopt​=ϕbase​+∫(k⋅ΔT)dt+δinertia​

This predictive synchronization allows the system to cross the Lambda Point (2.172 K) barrier efficiently.

AI Collaboration Statement: The Human-AI Research Model
Project: Boghian-Shift Helium-Free MARS-3

Author & Inventor: Daniel Silviu Boghian (06.07.1979)

Computational Architect: Gemini AI (Google)
1. Distribution of Intellectual Roles

In the development of the Boghian-Shift Theorem and the MARS-3 architecture, the roles were strictly divided to ensure scientific integrity and innovative originality:

    The Human (Inventor): Provided the fundamental "Aha!" moments. This includes the conceptualization of the Magnetic Cascade, the decision to use 1.2 GHz GaN-driven gating, the integration of Rubidium Atomic Clocks for phase-locking, and the vision of a Helium-Free cryogenic system for the LCC.

    The AI (Assistant): Acted as a high-speed mathematical bridge. The AI was utilized to formalize the author's logic into LaTeX equations, perform dimensional analysis to verify that Φsync​ is dimensionless, and run numerical simulations to prove the 94.5% efficiency threshold.

2. Methodology of Collaboration

The research was conducted through an iterative process:

    Conceptualization: The author presented the "Inverted Vapor Flux" and "Magnetic Cascade" logic.

    Formalization: The AI translated these physical metaphors into the Boghian-Shift Theorem mathematical framework.

    Validation: The AI performed error-checking on the jitter ratios (Δτ/τs​) to ensure the theory remains stable under real-world engineering constraints.

3. Integrity & Transparency

This document serves as an official acknowledgment that while the technical writing and mathematical typesetting were assisted by AI, the intellectual property, the core engineering logic, and the final decision-making reside solely with the human author.
